## Abstract
This project is designed to provide the user with a randomly selected affirmation or mantra. Upon page load, the user will see that they can click one of two buttons, **affirmation** and **mantra**.

Once the user has chosen between **affirmation** or **mantra**, they can press the **Receive Message** button to receive their randomly selected **affirmation** or **mantra**. The user is not able to click **Receive Message** until they have chosen either **affirmation** or **mantra** above.

The generated message will take the place of the yoga person image in the box below. The user can continue to click **Receive Message** and they will continue to receive random messages from the section of their choice.

When messages begin appearing in place of the yoga person icon, the user will see two more buttons appear below. The button on the left, **Clear Message**, will clear out the currently shown message on the screen, and replace the message with the original yoga person icon.

The button on the right, **I'm not feeling this one...**, will do a little bit more than just clearing the message. It will remove the currently shown message from it's respective section (**affirmations**, or **mantras**), and prevent it from being shown again.

When **I'm not feeling this one...** is clicked, the yoga person icon will re-appear in the box above, with an additional message that lets the user know that the message has been removed. In subsequent presses of the **Receive Message** button, the user will no longer see the message that has been removed.

## Wins
  - Completed provided comp, with a functional Minimally Viable Product
  - Completed two of the potential extension features, **Error handling and clear button**, and **User can delete a message**
  - gained valuable experience in composing HTML documents with CSS styling applied.
  - Built a whole interact-able web-page from scratch! That feels so cool!
  - managed my branches, Pull Requests, and GitHub process much more effectively than the previous project.

## Challenges + Improvements
  - I attempted to implement the optional feature: **View All Messages Interface**, before I decided on the two features that are in the finished product. I made a decent amount of progress on this feature, before I got a bit overwhelmed with the amount of work I still had in front of me. I didn't plan this feature out effectively and ended up not thinking everything through as well as I would have preferred. I decided to abandon that branch, and ended up opening up new branches to implement the **Error handling and clear button**, and **User can delete a message** features instead.
  - I learned a lot of interesting techniques while I was working on the **All Messages Interface** but felt that I would not be satisfied with the progress on the feature by the time of the project deadline. I'm a little bummed that I didn't complete something that I started and put work into, but at the end of the day I felt it was more important to deliver a finished product rather than something that I was truly unhappy with.
